<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Chapter 2.3: Entity Scripts and <code>self</code></h2>
<p>The real power of VScript comes from attaching scripts <em>directly to other entities</em>. Almost any entity in Hammer (a <code>prop_dynamic</code>, a <code>func_button</code>) can have a script attached to it via its <code>vscripts</code> keyvalue.</p>
<p>If you have ten turrets, you can give each one the same script, and each will run its own independent version of that script.</p>
<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4"><code>self</code>: The Most Important Variable</h3>
<p>When a script is attached to an entity, VScript gives it a special variable named <code>self</code>.</p>
<p><code>self</code> is a <strong>script handle</strong>. It's your script's connection to the entity it's attached to. It's how you tell the turret to fire, or the door to open.</p>

    <div class="flex justify-center items-center">
        <div class="w-1/3 text-right"><code>self</code></div>

</div>
<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Using <code>self</code> to Act</h3>
<p>You use <code>self</code> to call methods (functions) that affect the entity. Think of it as telling the entity to do something to itself.</p>
<pre><code class="language-squirrel">// This script is attached to a cube (prop_physics).
// It defines a function that can be called to change the cube's color.

function TurnRed() {
    // 'self' here refers to THIS specific cube.
    // We call the SetColor method on it to change its render color.
    EntFireByHandle(self, "Color", "255 0 0", 0, null, null) // Sets color to Red
    printl(self.GetName() + " is now red!")
}

// To use this, you would create an output from another entity (like a button)
// targeting this cube, and use the "RunScriptCode" input with the parameter "TurnRed()".
